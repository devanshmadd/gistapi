Thank you for the opportunity. I have completed the assignment which fetches the (public)user gists available.

I fetch the gists using the getPublicGists and then store them in an array and then filter them based on the input of the user.

This project should be built using the base project you should clone from [here](https://github.com/dubizzle-onboarding/gistapi). -> Cloned and used it

It uses Github's [Octokit REST API](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v18/) -> used 

### Whats Expected
- Create a list of public gist available. -> done
- Search Gists for the username. -> done
- Use state management to save data and not make duplicate calls. -> done
- Show all the relevant meta data available in the response. -> done displaying the created and last_updated date but you can see all the other data fetched in the console so based on the requirements that can be fetched.
- We do expect you to create and use proper component hierarchy keeping service and components exclusive. 
- Please use git version control.

### Good to have
- Proper handling of error message and no results screens. -> done
- Clean UI similar to [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dubizzle-onboarding/gistapi/main/design_inspiration.png). -> done
- Unit Tests. 
- Optimised rendering. -> done
- Code comments. -> done
- Type checking of the params. 

### Thank you
